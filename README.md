# Phishing Campaign Project
## Overview
This project, supervised by M. Beno√Æt Parthoens and Mme. Julie Van de Wijngaert, and conducted by Hakan Aysan, aims to explore the intricacies of phishing and spear-phishing attacks. Through a series of controlled phishing attempts targeting students and faculty at Helmo, this project seeks to raise awareness, educate on identifying phishing attempts, and evaluate the effectiveness of such campaigns.

## Objectives
Sensitize the targeted audience about the dangers and sophistication of phishing attacks.
Educate individuals on how to identify phishing emails through their characteristics.
Evaluate the level of awareness and preparedness against phishing among students and faculty members.
## Methodology
The campaign was structured around four main attempts, each designed to retrieve specific information through phishing:

Attempt 1: Targeted at all computer science students at Helmo, aiming to retrieve a B1 schedule by posing as a student on a Facebook group.
Attempt 2: Aimed at the Helmo secretary, attempting to gather a list of B1 Info & Sec students by impersonating an event organizer.
Attempt 3: Focused on B1 Sec students, with the objective of obtaining their student list through a close accomplice.
Attempt 4: Targeted at B1 Info students, trying to collect their list by creating a scenario around a lost charger.
Each attempt was meticulously planned, from the creation of fake identities to the development of plausible scenarios designed to elicit the desired response without raising suspicion.

## Results
The results varied across the attempts, with some achieving their objective while others did not receive the anticipated response. Overall, the campaign managed to:

Attempt 1: Successfully retrieved the schedule from one Helmo student.
Attempt 2: Did not receive a response from the targeted secretary.
Attempt 3: Successfully obtained the list through the accomplice.
Attempt 4: Initially failed but eventually succeeded in a revised attempt, retrieving the desired student list.
## Personal Achievements
Emails Sent: 37
Students Captured: 3
Success Rate: 8,1%
## General Findings
